A caution can be given to anyone over 10 years old for a minor offence such as graffiti. Although a caution doesn’t count as a criminal conviction and is considered ‘spent’ immediately under the Rehabilitation of Offenders Act 1974 it will probably show up in the future on DBS checks (previously known as a CRB), particularly enhanced DBSs.

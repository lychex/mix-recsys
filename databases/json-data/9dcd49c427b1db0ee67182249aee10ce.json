As you’ve not paid enough Class 1 National Insurance Contributions, you won’t be able to get contribution-based JSA. But there is another type of JSA – income-based – that you may be able to claim. Income-based JSA is means-tested, and so would depend on your household income and savings. If you have a partner and they’re working, you may not meet the criteria for income-based JSA. However, your partner may be in a position to claim for other financial help, such as Tax Credits. You can get a rough idea of what benefits you might be entitled to, and how much, using this online benefits calculator. It will also tell you how to apply. You could also visit a local advice agency, such as the Citizens Advice Bureau (CAB), and ask them to run a full benefits check. Next Steps Chat about this subject on our Discussion Boards.

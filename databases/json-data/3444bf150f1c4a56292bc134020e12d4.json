Not only does it stop you being paid nearly nothing, it’s also reviewed every year to ensure the rates are fair. How much should I get paid? From 1st April 2020, the National Minimum Wage is: £8.20 per hour for those aged 21 or over £6.45 for those aged 18-20 £4.55 per hour for those aged 16-17 £4.15 an hour for apprentices under 19, or over 19 and in the first year of their apprenticeship I’m being paid less than the minimum wage! What can I do? First, talk to your employer. If you are worried about doing this you can contact your local Citizens Advice Bureau beforehand. If this doesn’t work, you can call the Pay and Work Rights Helpline on 0800 917 2368, or fill out an online form, and they’ll help you with your dispute. Alternatively, contact HMRC. If they find you’ve not been paid fairly, they’ll send out a notice to your employer asking them to pay you in arrears, plus an extra penalty for not paying minimum wage. If your employer still refuses to pay, HMRC will take them to court on your behalf. You can also challenge them yourself by taking your case to an employment tribunal -although you only have three months to do this. For more advice on getting paid what you deserve, read the advice on The Citizens Advice Bureau (CAB) website. Why wouldn’t I get the minimum wage?
